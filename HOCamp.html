        <p>Thaddeus Campbell was  High Overseer. Despite Campbell's high position within the restrictive Abbey of the Everyman, he is known to lead an extremely decadent and deviant lifestyle.</p>
        <p> The Heart reveals that "He breaks each of the Seven Strictures daily. It is his own private joke".</p>
        <p>He maintains a secret chamber beneath the Office of the High Overseer that is filled with notes discussing his dealings with the Golden Cat and an audiograph regarding Corvo Attano's escape from Coldridge Prison. </p>

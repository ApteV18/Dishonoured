        <p>Samuel acts as a boatman for the Loyalist Conspiracy, transporting Corvo to and from almost all of his main missions. He occasionally provides useful information on the locations Corvo is visiting, informing him of potential roadblocks and areas to be avoided.</p>
        <p> He is standoffish, rarely entering the Hound Pits Pub he tells Lydia Brooklaine that because he has been at sea for so long, he cannot sleep in a normal bed, and therefore sleeps in a makeshift hovel near the dock rather than in a room at the pub.</p>
        <p> According to the Heart, Samuel greatly respects Corvo, and his opinion of the man changes based on Corvo's actions during his missions.</p>
